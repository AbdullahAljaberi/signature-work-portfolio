# 🎓 Signature Work Portfolio – Abdullah Aljaberi

## 🔰 Introduction

My Signature Work submission for CISC 480 – Senior Capstone at the University of St. Thomas is this portfolio. I have produced projects in Computer Science that represent my technical progress and my own beliefs. I work on these projects to directly connect with what’s important to me: business, creativity and solid logic.

What I show in this work is both my practices and tech applications that fit the Saint Thomas mission which include contributing to the community, serving people and using knowledge in meaningful and helpful ways.

## 💼 Project 1: Delta Al-Battha Auto Parts Website  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/DBP)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/DBP/)

I built this website for my father’s company in the auto parts industry. The site is in both Arabic and English, easy to navigate and responsive. The idea is it to make it easier for customers to find and order Nissan parts and to manage stock for the staff.

**What makes it important:**
Working on this project is very personal for me. It helps family businesses succeed by bringing in useful technology. Building something that works well is important to me, but fulfilling is also working on things helpful to those who use my sites.

**Technical Stack:**
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are currently in use, followed by backend integration.

## 🎨 Project 2: Clown Face Music Visualizer  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/music-visualizer)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/music-visualizer/)

This work uses Three.js and the Web Audio API to move a 3D clown face to the rhythm of the music. The features on the face react to what you hear and the flames respond to the bass.

**How does this matter?**  
I learned how to create visuals of sound, render 3D images and connect art and programming. It comes from my drive to see how much can be done using nothing but a web browser.

**Domain-specific insight:**
I explored digital audio frequencies, analysed buffers and scaled meshes in real time using a mouse — all this in a signal processing toolkit.

## 🐍 Project 3: Snake Game  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/snake)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/snake/)

Game created using p5.js that also uses sound libraries. There are special sounds for crunching food and ending the game included in the game. The game is restarted after you collide with anything.

**How does this matter?**   
I did this as one of my first projects. Using such a system provided the confidence needed to transform logic into visuals and understand game loops, how keyboards are handled and real-time changes to the game.

**Technical Concepts:** 
Blocks for the game loop, watching objects, determining collisions and handling audio events

## 🧠 Final Reflection

They show the steps I have taken, from getting familiar with programming language, to actually using technology to help others, solve their needs and enjoy myself. Learning to handle web development from my family business website, try different creativity with music and understand basic concepts through games — each time I learned something valuable.

They are a way to show the mission of St. Thomas — helping others, creating with purpose and building something good.
