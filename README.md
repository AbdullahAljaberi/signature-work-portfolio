# 🎓 Signature Work Portfolio – Abdullah Aljaberi

## 🔰 Introduction

This portfolio is my Signature Work submission for **CISC 480 – Senior Capstone** at the University of St. Thomas. As a Computer Science student, I have developed projects that reflect both my technical growth and personal values. Each project here represents a real-world connection: whether it's helping my family's business, exploring creativity through programming, or mastering the fundamentals of logic and interactivity.

Through this work, I demonstrate not only what I’ve learned but also how I apply technology in ways that align with the **St. Thomas mission** — contributing to the common good, serving communities, and using knowledge for practical, meaningful impact.

## 💼 Project 1: Delta Al-Battha Auto Parts Website  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/DBP)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/DBP/)

This is a website I developed for my father’s auto parts business. It’s bilingual (Arabic and English), responsive, and user-friendly. The goal is to give customers an easier way to find and buy Nissan parts while helping staff manage inventory.

**Why it matters:**  
This project is deeply personal. It brings value to a family-run business by bridging it with technology. I learned web development with a purpose — not just building something that works, but something that **serves people**.

**Technical Stack:**  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with plans for backend integration)

## 🎨 Project 2: Clown Face Music Visualizer  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/music-visualizer)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/music-visualizer/)

This creative project uses **Three.js** and the Web Audio API to animate a 3D clown face in sync with music frequency. The facial features react in real-time, and flames animate based on bass response.

**Why it matters:**  
This taught me about sound visualization, 3D rendering, and how art and code can work together. It reflects my curiosity and desire to push boundaries of what can be done inside a browser.

**Domain-specific insight:**  
I worked with digital audio frequencies, buffer analysis, and mesh scaling based on real-time input — an introduction to signal processing in an interactive form.

## 🐍 Project 3: Snake Game  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/snake)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/snake/)

A classic snake game implemented using **p5.js** and sound libraries. The game includes custom audio for crunching food and game-over events. It keeps score and restarts on collision.

**Why it matters:**  
This was one of my early projects. It gave me confidence to turn logic into visual output and helped me master game loops, keyboard input, and real-time updates.

**Technical Concepts:**  
Game loop, object tracking, collision detection, audio event control

## 🧠 Final Reflection

These three projects reflect my journey from learning programming syntax to applying technology for real people, real needs, and real fun. From a business site that empowers my family to a music visualizer that explores creativity, to a game that shows fundamentals — each one taught me something important.

They also represent the mission of St. Thomas — using what I’ve learned to **serve others**, **create with purpose**, and **build for good**.
