# Signature Work Portfolio – Abdullah Aljaberi

## 🔰 Introduction

As a Computer Science student at the University of St. Thomas, I’ve worked on diverse projects that reflect my learning, values, and goals. This portfolio showcases three projects that are meaningful to me, both technically and personally. These works connect to the broader mission of contributing to the common good and using technology to make a positive impact.

## 💼 Project 1: Delta Batha Auto Parts Website  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/asajabi.github.io)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/DBP/)

This is a website I developed for my father’s small business that sells Nissan auto parts. I built the frontend entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is bilingual (Arabic and English) and designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

🛠️ *Note: This website is currently in progress. Future updates will include product search and checkout features.*

**Why it matters:**  
This project supports a family-owned small business and helps transition it into the digital age. It’s a real-world application of my web development skills and reflects the mission of using tech to serve others and uplift community business.

## 🎨 Project 2: Clown Face Music Visualizer  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/music-visualizer)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/music-visualizer/)

This creative project uses Three.js to visualize audio input in real time. The centerpiece is a 3D clown face that reacts dynamically to the rhythm and frequency of music.

### 🎧 Domain-Specific Insight:
I learned how to use the Web Audio API to capture frequency data and connect it to 3D mesh animations. This required working with digital signal analysis, timing synchronization, and geometry transformations — all tied together in a browser environment.

**Why it matters:**  
This project reflects the artistic potential of programming and how code can bring visual and auditory experiences together. It was also a fun, challenging way to learn about sound visualization and creative rendering.

## 🐍 Project 3: Snake Game  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AbdullahAljaberi/snake)  
🌐 [Live Site](https://abdullahaljaberi.github.io/snake/)
A classic Snake game I built to reinforce my programming fundamentals. It uses keyboard input, collision detection, and game state management. I designed the logic to allow automatic restart and increasing difficulty.

**Why it matters:**  
While simple, this project helped me understand game loops, conditionals, and real-time input handling. It was one of the early projects that gave me confidence in applying logic to interactive applications.

## 🧠 Final Reflection

These three projects showcase my technical growth, my creative interests, and my dedication to using my skills for practical outcomes. Whether it’s helping a family business, building a creative tool, or strengthening my logic, each project played a role in my development as a future IT professional.

They also reflect the mission of St. Thomas — not just gaining knowledge, but applying it in ways that serve, inspire, and build toward the common good.
